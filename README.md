##  Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and transformations  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features for better model performance  
- **Train-Test Split**: Preparing the dataset for training and evaluation  
- **Binary Classification Conversion**: Adjusting dataset for classification models  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using appropriate metrics  

##  Analysis & Results  
### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values using **mean/mode imputation**  
- Applied **standardization and normalization** for consistent data distribution  

### ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering  
- Created new features using **polynomial features, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection**  
- Removed irrelevant or highly correlated features to **avoid redundancy**  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Performance & Evaluation  
- Split data into **training (80%) and testing (20%)**  
- Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**  
- Visualized results with **confusion matrices and performance curves**  

##  Technologies Used  
This project utilizes the following libraries:  

- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations
